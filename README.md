# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is **Yulia Pratiwi**. I am a student at the University of Bengkulu currently in my 5th semester. I have a strong interest in the fields of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I enjoy collaborating and learning from fellow developers. If you're interested in discussing or collaborating on open-source projects, feel free to reach out to me.

Let's get to know each other better and explore the world of technology together! ðŸ˜Šâœ¨
